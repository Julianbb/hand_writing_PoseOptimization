## PoseOptimization 


Writing by julian in 2019.11.10, referring to some code by heyijia. 

This project is used for replacing PoseOptimization function in ORB-SLAM2. It doesn't depend on g2o. Actually, Eigen is enought for this project, but in order to keep same interface as ORB-SLAM2, OpenCV is needed. If you are interested in getting rid of OpenCV, you can modify some functions. It's easy work.
